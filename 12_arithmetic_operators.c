//ARITHMATIC OPERATORS
/*
Although we have done some works with arithmetic operators already. Let it be clear about some concepts regarding this topic. +, -, *, /, % ; 
These operators are + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and % (modulo).

{
    int num1=32, num2=56, multiplication;
    multiplication= num1* num2;         // here * is the arithmetic operator.
    printf("The result= %d\n", multiplication);

/*

            a+b=7;        --> here a and b are the operand, and + and = are the operators and 7 is the constant. and the whole this is called expression.
